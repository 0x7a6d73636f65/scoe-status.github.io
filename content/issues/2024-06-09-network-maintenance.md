**Update 2024-06-09 12:37AM**: The update has been completed successfully. We will be monitoring throughout Sunday for any issues. There may be unexpected downtime if a workaround needs to be put in place during the day.

**Time**: 2024-06-09 12:00:00AM

**Duration**: 3 hours

**Purpose**: The county firewall will receive a software update.

**Affected Services**: Internet connectivity will be unavailable for SCOE and enhanced services districts. Hosted services such as Aeries, Escape, SFTP (etc...) will be unavailable.

**Note**: We will be monitoring the county firewall throughout the rest of the day to verify the new software fixes our connectivity issue. There may be additional downtime during the day if I have to reimplement a workaround.
