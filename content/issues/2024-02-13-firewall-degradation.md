*2024-02-13 14:45:00* - Our case has been transferred to Engineering from Support.

*2024-02-13 13:57:00* - Cards are back in service.

*2024-02-13 13:40:00* - Cards are not automatically restarting. We are manually restarting the cards.

*2024-02-13 13:36:00* - Cards have rebooted causing an outage.

SCOE is currently working with our firewall vendor to resolve an issue with restarting line cards. Connectivity through SCOE is currently intermittent.
